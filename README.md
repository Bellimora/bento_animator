# Bento Animator

This is a bento animator script for LSL, should be able to handle your basic animation needs well enough.  Be aware I got an AGPL license on this which in short means if you use this script, keep the script full perms.  I don't mind the rest of the perms of the build, but the script file for this better be full with credit and a link to this repository (which should already be in the source code. so you don't have to do any additional work outside of keeping your animator script full perm).

If you've any questions feel free to contact me in the grid as Bellimora Resident, thank you.
